	<p>Make an in-circuit programmer <br>

	<div class="clear">
		<p><mark>haimish:</mark> homey, cozy, unpretentious <br>
		<mark>electrical resistance:</mark> measures the level of difficulty to pass an electrical current through a conductor, the inverse quantity is electrical conductance which measures the level of ease<br>
		<mark>pull-up/pull-down resistors:</mark> used to prevent floating by ensuring that the MCU input pin is either in high (pulled to VCC) or low state (pulled to Ground). Pull-up resistor is more common of the two - it is frequently connected to high voltage (often allocated to VCC) and pull-down is often connected to ground <br>
		<mark>capacitor:</mark> stores electric energy in an electric field between two conductive plates <br>
		<mark>diode:</mark> an electrical device that allows current to move through it in one direction with greater ease<br>
		<mark>clipper:</mark> prevents the output of a circuit from reaching a certain voltage without impacting the remaining waveform <br>
		<mark>differential signal mode:</mark> pair of traces between receiver and driver - one carries a negative signal while the other a positive one. These signals are equal and opposite, thus there is no return signal from ground - what travels along one trace comes back the other. The USB operates under this construct <br>
		<mark>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI):</mark> synchronously sends data between master (e.g. microcontroller) and slave (e.g. sensor, SD card) compotents by separating the clock and data lines
		<br>
		<mark>resonator:</mark> creates an external clock signal for the microcontroller <br>
		<mark>short:</mark> happen when current travels down an unintended path between two nodes intended to be at different voltages<br>
		<mark>open:</mark> the opposite of a short, i.e. lack of current between two nodes <br>
		<mark>Alternating Current (AC):</mark>current in which the flow of electrical charge periodically reverses direction <br>
		<mark>Direct Current (DC):</mark> the opposite of AC, i.e. the flow of electrical charge is in one direction only<br>
		<mark>trigger:</mark> a circuit that controls another circuit, converts inputs into outputs. The output remains constant until the input is sufficiently altered <br>

		<h3>Gersh</h3>
		<p>Since this is was my first foray into PCB production I thought to keep it simple and use the boilerplate template supplied in the week's lecture. I was rather pleased with 	the outcome – meet Gersh - an in-circuit programmer.</p>
