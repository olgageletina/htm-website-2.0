		<h3>Dodecahedron</h3>	
		<p class="description">With the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ_1jC2FrnY"> Nathan's awesome tutorial</a>, I made a parametric press-fit dodecahedron. At the base of the structure is a regular pentagon (Dih<sup>5</sup>symmetry, order 10), held together with circular parts. The shape is bound by a rectangular joints that can be resized dynamically. This was my first time using Rhino's Grasshopper plug-in. Albeit successful, the experience was largely frustrating – my efforts culminated in a <a href="files/og-dodecohedron.3dm">Rhino</a> and <a href="files/og-dodecohedron-gs.gh">Grasshopper</a> files. Finally, the piece was laser cut of our cardboard – it's aesthetic was designed to stimulate geometry I am considering for the light portion of my final project.

		<h3>Website</h3>
		<p>Using templated websites in the past has been frustrating – they never look right and editing the beehive of code these come with is never fun. For the sake of my sanity, I decided to flex my front-end prowess and create a minimal page from scratch – built easy to edit. <br>  
		Inspired by the class website I worked under the premise of less is more – no fancy effects or Javascript to start. The challenge was to make the page with an idiosyncratic “notebook” feel. One of the things I hoped to convey is how I take notes - whenever I come across an unfamiliar term, name, or principle I record it to look up at a later point. Thus, the first section of each week is devoted to this initiative – most of the highlighted terms are related to the course and some are an indication of other interests. <br> 
		The other important feature of the website it it’s aesthetic – a clean look with a touch of uniqueness. As an individual sensitive to typography, font selection is not a trivial matter. After going through a couple of permutations, I settled on a paring of Arvo and Cutive Mono (both are available for free on Google Fonts). While a fan of all things white, I thought to add a gradient in the background inspired by color palette of a sunset. Eventually, I hope to use this page as a sandbox for remodeling, <a href="http://geletina.com/">geletina.com</a> - my current website.</p>
