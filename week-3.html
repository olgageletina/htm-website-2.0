		<h3>Print</h3>
		<p>I returned to the same shape for this week's assigment, taking it a step further I designed (using Rhino) a dodecahedron  illustrative of the fact that a cube can be constructed from its vertices (Steinhaus 1999). I used the Formalabs and 3DWOX to make models at different scales. The first couple of attempts were trying – not enough support, too little resin, excessive support, etc.</p>

		<h3>Scan</h3>
		<p>Scanning an object posed its own set of challenges. Sense didn't seem to respond particularly well to my attempts of scanning a bust or small objects (about the size of a handful or less). However it did scan a bottle of Goop soap nicely (inserting an extra "o" for good measure). My dodecahedron didn't pass the Sense size threshold, so I tried to capture the shape using 123D Catch which did not turn out particularly well either.</p>

		<h3>Scan some more</h3>
		<p>This 3D heat scan was created in a collaboration with James Penn, a wizard of sorts. The idea behind it was to draw on the visuals heat produces as well as to scan a feature that extends beyond what is visible to the naked eye. <br>
		Our set-up included a stepper motor, two breadboards, an arduino, mystery electrical components, and a couple of glasses of whiskey.</p>
