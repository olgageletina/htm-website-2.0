	<h2><mark>Proposal:</mark></h2>
	<p>Leveraging several aspects of the course curriculum, I aim to create a responsive light structure driven by acousto-optic effects.

		<p> This work is a reaction to the visceral works of a New York City ensemble <i>Hess Is More</i>.  Earning critical acclaim as “[the 2014] album-of-the-year candidate” by The Lowbrow Reader, the octet creates experimental dance music rooted in jazz, krautrock, and afrobeat. <br>
		While the apparatus is designed to accompany a live performance by the band, it will be versatile enough to function as a stand-alone installation. Its primary components will be comprised of multifaceted pieces of glass (figure 1), a microphone, a light source, as well as reflective and transmissive gratings. Its output will be a series of prismatic images (figure 2) with the exact aesthetics to be determined in the later stages of the project. I expect the resulting image to be evocative of the band’s emblem – a constellation-like pattern encased in a circle (figure 3). Simultaneously translating the environment and reacting to it, light will thus pair with sound.

		<h3>Material</h3>
		<p>After experiementing with glass, I found that in order to fulfill my wish for prismatic images I would have to commission a custom piece, which would be cost prohibitive, amongst other things. <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/section.CBA/people/Oran/index.html">Dan Oran</a>, a classmate of mine recommended polycarbonate which has fantastic optic properties. When material is manipulated with heat it fractures internally and refracts, to elaborate on this effect I lined the bottom of my structure with reflective film.</p>

		<p>To house the wiring, I made the base our of sheet metal steel. The process was much smoother than my first attempt at working with the medium.</p>

		<h3>Electronics</h3>
		<p>Initially I thought I would rotate the light fixture by having a solenoid (or a series of). After making the solenoid, I realized that the designed I originally envisioned took on too many variables. So instead I adapted Neil's LED array to spead along a wider distance. Having had established a serial connection in the weeks prior I was able to program the array to communicate with my microphone board with relative ease. <br></p>

		<h3>Conclusive Thoughts</h3>
		<p>I am slightly disappointed with the outcome of my project, there is something about the aesthetics that's amiss and it is not as eloquent from a technological standpoint. This is a good lesson to take on projects that are more manageable in scope and fulfill a single criteria rather than many, i.e. either making light modulation piece with a sophisticated technical underpinning or an art object – trying to do everything at once results in mediocracy. </p>
