	<p>Leveraging several aspects of the course curriculum, I aim to create a responsive light structure driven by acousto-optic effects.

		<p> This work is a reaction to the visceral works of a New York City ensemble <i>Hess Is More</i>.  Earning critical acclaim as “[the 2014] album-of-the-year candidate” by The Lowbrow Reader, the octet creates experimental dance music rooted in jazz, krautrock, and afrobeat. <br>
		While the apparatus is designed to accompany a live performance by the band, it will be versatile enough to function as a stand-alone installation. Its primary components will be comprised of multifaceted pieces of glass (figure 1), a microphone, a light source, as well as reflective and transmissive gratings. Its output will be a series of prismatic images (figure 2) with the exact aesthetics to be determined in the later stages of the project. I expect the resulting image to be evocative of the band’s emblem – a constellation-like pattern encased in a circle (figure 3). Simultaneously translating the environment and reacting to it, light will thus pair with sound.
