		<h1>Hello... EAGLE?</h1>
		<p>
		This week's assignment came with a set of unexpected technical challenges. From Eagle's lack of user-friendliness (the best of which, in my opinion, is the lack of partial search) to the Roland mill refusing to cut the outer border of my board (table saw came in handy) - pit falls were around every corner, until I got to soldering. Words cannot convey the unbridled joy I felt when testing my board - all of the traces seemed to check out.

		<p>The board above has two additional LED's - here are my Eagle <a href="files/og-hello.sch">schematic</a> and <a href="files/og-hello.brd">board</a> files. </p>

		<h1>Morti</h1>
		<p>In an attempt to get better acquainted with circuit board construction and to have some fun, I designed a custom circuit board in the shape of a skull.</p>
