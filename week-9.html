	<h3>Composites</h3>
	<p>Inspired by the work of <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/section.Harvard/people/Karimpour/index.html">Amir Karimpour</a>, I decided to experiement with Maya to create an interesting form for my composite. <br>
	Overall, this week was lacking in failure. Everything came together nicely - from the machining on a Shopbot, which was a breeze, down to the finished fibers. Since the purpose of the work was mostly aesthetic, I opted for linen in favor of burlap, which I dry fitted by making a few incisions lining the crevices beforehand. The form came out beautifully with a resolution so fine that even the toolpath was apparent.<br></p>
