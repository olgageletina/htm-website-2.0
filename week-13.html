	<h1>Final Project Update</h1>
	<p>With the support of my classmate <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/section.Harvard/people/Garbarini/index.html">Logan</a> I made substantial progress in encoding my microphone board with a beat detection algorithm using <a href="http://dpeckett.com/beat-detection-on-the-arduino">Damian Peckett's method</a>. In order to successfully implement the code,  I had to swap out the ATtiny45 with a ATtiny85 chip as the <a href="files/beat_detection.ino">Arduino IDE sketch</a> was consuming in excess of 90% of the t45. The other configuration issues included running the Burn Bootloader command, and sanity checks for misplaced resistors (subpar soldering in the chip replacement process).

	<h1>Dream Machine</h1>
	<p>Unfortunately, due to finals I had to miss the recitation and the corresponding group project. However, I took this as a cue for a creative self-directed endeavor. I started with a question. What is my dream machine? As a big fan of soft robotics, my dream machine is a wobbing hug bot that produces sounds at a comforting frequency and on occassion does dirty dishes. Complete with piezoelectric sensors the hug machine would be activated at moments of emotional lows.</p>
