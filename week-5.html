		<p>
		<mark>Galvanometer systems:</mark> based on moving mirror technology, similar to what is used to create laser light shows <br>
		<mark>Garolite:</mark> fiberglass-epoxy laminate – high strength and stable under temperature fluctuations - a cheaper alternative to carbon fiber <br>
		<mark>encapsulation:</mark> OOP concept bringing together data and functions that manipulate said data - led to advancement in data hiding<br>
		<mark>runout:</mark> inaccuracy due to misalignment between a tool and the main axis – will result in a larger hole than the diameter of the drill <br>
		<mark>LED Light Pipe:</mark> optical fiber or a solid transparent plastic rod for transmitting light from an LED mounted mounted on a PCB to the user interface <br>
		<mark>minimal surface:</mark> a surface that locally minimizes its area and has the mean curvature of 0 <br>
		<mark>Seifert surface:</mark> a surface whose boundary is a link of a knot - e.g. Mobius strip<br>
		<mark>isosurface:</mark> three-dimensional analog of a countour line - a level set of a continuous function whose whose domain is a 3D space <br>
		<mark>Marching cubes:</mark> computer-graphics algorithm published in 1987 for extracting polygonal mesh from isosurface voxels <br>

		<h1>Big as a collection of many</h1>
		<p> I chose to interpert this week's assignment a bit differently – rather than making one big thing, I thought to make a series of smaller things that together amalgamate into a bigger thing.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h1>Wood</h1>
		<p>In an effort to make home feel more like home, I created two storage units from the wood scaps found at the GSD.</p>
		<ul class="portfolio-grid">
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/wood.jpg"></li>
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/wood_2.jpg"></li>
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/wood_1.jpg"></li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h1>Metal</h1>
		<p>Working with metal has been something I've always wanted to do – sheet metal in particular has a very alluring craft property. Yet, I never had access to a metal shop until now. <br>
		This week's assignment presented me with the perfect opportunity to try something new. I sought to create an abstract form that would serve as a scuptural light fixture. The aesthetics of a capped pyramid were paired with openings from which light would be able to escape.While I was content with my design in rhino, the final product was disappointing. 
		</p>
		<ul class="portfolio-grid">
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/metal.jpg"></li>
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/metal_1.jpg"></li>
			<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/metal_2.jpg"></li>
		</ul>
		<p>On the brighter side, I got to use a grinder and nibbler; rolling and hammering  metal into shape was a very satisfying, empowering, and addicting aspect of the task.</p>
