		<h1>Dodecahedron</h1>	
		<p class="description">With the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ_1jC2FrnY"> Nathan's awesome tutorial</a>, I made a parametric press-fit dodecahedron. At the base of the structure is a regular pentagon (Dih<sup>5</sup>symmetry, order 10), held together with circular parts. The shape is bound by a rectangular joints that can be resized dynamically. This was my first time using Rhino's Grasshopper plug-in. Albeit successful, the experience was largely frustrating – my efforts culminated in a <a href="files/og-dodecohedron.3dm">Rhino</a> and <a href="files/og-dodecohedron-gs.gh">Grasshopper</a> files. Finally, the piece was laser cut of our cardboard – it's aesthetic was designed to stimulate geometry I am considering for the light portion of my final project.

		<h1>Website</h1>
		<p>Using templated websites in the past has been frustrating – they never look right and editing the beehive of code these come with is never fun. For the sake of my sanity, I decided to flex my front-end prowess and create a minimal page from scratch – built easy to edit. <br>  
		Inspired by the class website I worked under the premise of less is more – no fancy effects or Javascript to start. The challenge was to make the page with an idiosyncratic “notebook” feel. One of the things I hoped to convey is how I take notes - whenever I come across an unfamiliar term, name, or principle I record it to look up at a later point. Thus, the first section of each week is devoted to this initiative – most of the highlighted terms are related to the course and some are an indication of other interests. <br> 
		The other important feature of the website it it’s aesthetic – a clean look with a touch of uniqueness. As an individual sensitive to typography, font selection is not a trivial matter. After going through a couple of permutations, I settled on a paring of Arvo and Cutive Mono (both are available for free on Google Fonts). While a fan of all things white, I thought to add a gradient in the background inspired by color palette of a sunset. Eventually, I hope to use this page as a sandbox for remodeling, <a href="http://geletina.com/">geletina.com</a> - my current website.</p>

		<h1>Print</h1>
		<p>I returned to the same shape for this week's assigment, taking it a step further I designed (using Rhino) a dodecahedron  illustrative of the fact that a cube can be constructed from its vertices (Steinhaus 1999). I used the Formalabs and 3DWOX to make models at different scales. The first couple of attempts were trying – not enough support, too little resin, excessive support, etc.</p>

		<p>Scanning an object posed its own set of challenges. Sense didn't seem to respond particularly well to my attempts of scanning a bust or small objects (about the size of a handful or less). However it did scan a bottle of Goop soap nicely (inserting an extra "o" for good measure). My dodecahedron didn't pass the Sense size threshold, so I tried to capture the shape using 123D Catch which did not turn out particularly well either.</p>

		<h1>Hello... EAGLE?</h1>
		<p>
		This week's assignment came with a set of unexpected technical challenges. From Eagle's lack of user-friendliness (the best of which, in my opinion, is the lack of partial search) to the Roland mill refusing to cut the outer border of my board (table saw came in handy) - pit falls were around every corner, until I got to soldering. Words cannot convey the unbridled joy I felt when testing my board - all of the traces seemed to check out.

		<h1>Big as a collection of many</h1>

		<p>Working with metal has been something I've always wanted to do – sheet metal in particular has a very alluring craft property. Yet, I never had access to a metal shop until now. <br>
		This week's assignment presented me with the perfect opportunity to try something new. I sought to create an abstract form that would serve as a scuptural light fixture. The aesthetics of a capped pyramid were paired with openings from which light would be able to escape.While I was content with my design in rhino, the final product was disappointing.

	<h1>Positive to Positive Mold to Negative Mold to Positive to...</h1>
	<p>Having had cast a relief sculpture previously, I thought myself an expert. The hubris was unwarranted, in fact I think it would have been wiser to espouse the Socratic paradox ("I know one thing: that I know nothing"). <br>
	However for willful person, there is no going back - I set to make a light fixture - a hallow shape to house a light scocket with a crevice for the wire. Working in Rhino, I first designed the positive then with consult from the gurus I worked on making a positive three piece mold. <br>
	The process was a laborious one. Yet by Sunday morning I thought I had it down flat. It was time to mill. While my shape was relatively small it was still larger than any of the readily available end mills. So on Tuesday morning I negotiated to borrow a longer bit from the Harvard Design School.</p>
	<ul class="portfolio-grid">

		<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/moldprocess_2.jpg"></li>
		<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/moldprocess_3.jpg"></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The trials and tribulations did not end there. Shortly after the process was done I realized I made a few error in mold, which either the original design or the milling instructions could have compensated for. I resolved the errors retroactively using tape, an exacto knife, and a sprinkling of Hydrostone. <br>
	It was then time for OOMOO, whether due to my poor mixing/pouring skills or the compromised A/B parts the substance was foamy – a texture my final piece inherited.</p>

		<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/mold_2.jpg"></li>
		<li class="grid-item"><img src="img/mold_3.jpg"></li>
	</ul>
	<p>All's well that ends well - after a semi-disasterous process of "free-ing" my OOMOO negative mold from its positive master and modifying the negative mold with clay and a blade, I was ready to pour.</p>

Similarly, the milling and soldering was smooth sailing. Until... <br>
	I realized (only after my board was completely finished) that one of the traces was improperly cut. To mitigate this issue I turned to my trusty friend - the X-Acto Knife. Yet despite my best intentions I cut the wrong trace. Dismayed at first, I hacked my way through it. Since the trace was under the microchip, neither a jumper wire nor 0 ohm resistor would do so I improvised by adding a piece of copper. </p>

	My next steps are to attain a better understanding of python script and the information being sent through serial. From there I would like to configure the LED to light up once a certain threshhold of sound is reached. All efforts moving toward developing a beat recognition algorithm for my final project.

	<h1>Composites</h1>
	<p>Inspired by the work of <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/section.Harvard/people/Karimpour/index.html">Amir Karimpour</a>, I decided to experiement with Maya to create an interesting form for my composite. <br>
	Overall, this week was lacking in failure. Everything came together nicely - from the machining on a Shopbot, which was a breeze, down to the finished fibers. Since the purpose of the work was mostly aesthetic, I opted for linen in favor of burlap, which I dry fitted by making a few incisions lining the crevices beforehand. The form came out beautifully with a resolution so fine that even the toolpath was apparent.<br></p>

		<p> This work is a reaction to the visceral works of a New York City ensemble <i>Hess Is More</i>.  Earning critical acclaim as “[the 2014] album-of-the-year candidate” by The Lowbrow Reader, the octet creates experimental dance music rooted in jazz, krautrock, and afrobeat. <br>
		While the apparatus is designed to accompany a live performance by the band, it will be versatile enough to function as a stand-alone installation. Its primary components will be comprised of multifaceted pieces of glass (figure 1), a microphone, a light source, as well as reflective and transmissive gratings. Its output will be a series of prismatic images (figure 2) with the exact aesthetics to be determined in the later stages of the project. I expect the resulting image to be evocative of the band’s emblem – a constellation-like pattern encased in a circle (figure 3). Simultaneously translating the environment and reacting to it, light will thus pair with sound.
