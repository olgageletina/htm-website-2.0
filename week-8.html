	<h3>Beats and such</h3>
	<p>For this week I chose to do an analog microphone board, with an additional LED. Designed in EAGLE, my <a href="files/sound-board.sch">schematic</a> and <a href="files/sound-board.brd">board</a> took substantially less time than before. Similarly, the milling and soldering was smooth sailing. Until... <br>
	I realized (only after my board was completely finished) that one of the traces was improperly cut. To mitigate this issue I turned to my trusty friend - the X-Acto Knife. Yet despite my best intentions I cut the wrong trace. Dismayed at first, I hacked my way through it. Since the trace was under the microchip, neither a jumper wire nor 0 ohm resistor would do so I improvised by adding a piece of copper. </p>

	<p>Using the code posted on the website I was able to successfully program the board.<br></p>

	<p>
	My next steps are to attain a better understanding of python script and the information being sent through serial. From there I would like to configure the LED to light up once a certain threshhold of sound is reached. All efforts moving toward developing a beat recognition algorithm for my final project.
